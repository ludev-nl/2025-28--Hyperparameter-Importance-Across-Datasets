# This is your team's git repository âœ¨

Use this repository to develop the code of your project.

On GitHub, a Project has been prepared for you to organize your sprints.
Use [Milestones][milestones] to associate issues to sprints, and then use the SCRUM board to keep track of their status.

We have added the MIT license, but you are free to license your code differently, if you prefer.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not commit binaries, documents, or other course material to this repository.
> Code committed should be your own: do not copy code of external dependencies into the repository.
> (Consider using [git submodules][submodules] to track external dependencies.)

Refer to the manuals in the course material to get started. Good luck!
